				<p> 
					Users are interested in learning more about plants they encounter in nature. It is difficult to look
					up information about plants by their features. Our solution should provide users with a way to easily 
					identify plants by their characteristics and determine whether or not they are safe to touch, eat, etc.

				<p> 
					Brainstorming from February 5, 2021:

					The linked file is a PDF of the affinity diagram. The affinity diagram contains many of Plant Finder's
					intended features. User experience and functionality was addressed and grouped into four categories as 
					seen in the image.
